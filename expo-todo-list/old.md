# negative notes
I am giving up the notion of 'OIC' though

## different logics
red,(no) black(neither), blue(both), green(yes)?


# bin
TODO: must get the available logic modules and judge all statements by //
different logics

the module should show aprallel lines, divided by topic
like in 5d chess, isntead of timelines different topics
by default colapsed,so the statements not exactly at the same
and can select just one topic and see it in other works



## from definitions
it can't be

why are defintions like mental objects?
what are physical objects?
what are their properties?
- persistent in time
- can be accessed by different people

so that if talking about chairs is in some sense valid, same appplies to out mental representations, so to speak

but here we just talk about defintions when there is some problem with
the default, implicit ones

about definition
it needs to be exhaustive set of places that it belongs;
so we have the primary definition and exhaustive Definition
but the unique identifiers = by author and timstamp = context sensitive
